      <p>
        My love, I wish you a very, very happy new year. As this new year is about to begin, I want you to slowly fade away everything that weighed you down this past year — and carry forward only the good memories, even though the every second that i live with you is so good and special but still these are some of them , the warm moments, and the love that made you smile.
        <br><br>
        So let’s start this year with something close to my heart — some of <strong>my favorite memories with you</strong>. I hope, somewhere deep down, they’re your favorites too 🖤

        As this year comes to an end, there’s just one thing my heart keeps wishing — that I was right there with you. I wish I could kiss you softly, hold you close, and end this year with the best feeling possible… with you.
        <br><br>
        And as the new year begins, I want to start it the same way — with love, warmth, and us. Even if we’re apart, my heart is choosing you, stepping into this new year with you, and holding onto the hope of all the beautiful moments waiting for us ahead.
        <br><br>
        Happy New Year, my love 🤍 I’m carrying you with me into every tomorrow.
